# Learning Notes

This repository collects my study notes and summaries from **CS50x** and other future courses.

For now, it covers what I've learned in **Week 0** - the basics of how computers think and how to design logic visually.

## Current Progress

* CS50x - Week 0
    * Understanding what algorithms are
    * Representing logic with flowcharts
    * Creating simple programs in Scratch
    * Thinking step-by-step like a computer

## Structure

Each topic has it own folder with notes or small exercises.

As I move through CS50x and beyond, new topics (Python, SQL, etc.) will be added here.
