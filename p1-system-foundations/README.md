## What I Learned

With **Week 0 of CS50x**, I learned subjects of computer science like data, binary, and algorithms. I knew the words before, but not what they really meant. It explains that computer science is about solving problems using computers. We give input, the computer process it with logic and math, gives output.

When it comes to "problem solving," for me it means we have to find a solution in a way a computer can understand and run. If we have an idea for the output, we need to figure out what the input and steps should be. We write those steps using a programming language, for example Python, C, or Java.

Data is information that computers store as bits (0 and 1), using on and off states in hardware. The computer handles these bits as numbers, and we decide what the numbers actually represent.

Algorithms are the step-by-step instructions that the computer follows to solve a problem. It's a big topic, and I can't explain everything about it yet.

Let's move with Week 1 of CS50x, it's about particular language program, C, `printf("Hello, world!")`, one of older language program. Plus, with "framework" of CS50 in VSCode, it was not very difficult to understand a basic like variable, conditional, operators, loops, etc. since I already learned a bit about JavaScript, of course, it was difficult pesoucode but definition is almost same. However, I understand better it than before, lectures by Professor Malan were very clear.
