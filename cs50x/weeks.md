# CS50x - Week 0 Notes

1. What is computer science?

It's about solving problems using computers.
You give **input**, the computer **processes** it (using logic and math), and gives **output**.

2. What is data?

Computers store everything as bits -- tiny 0s and 2s.
8 bits make a byte. Every letter, color, and sound becomes numbers.

3. Text: ASCII and Unicode

* **ASCII** gives numbers to letters (A = 16). Works only for English.
* **Unicode** is bigger. It includes all languages and emoji.

4. Images and Sound

* **Images** are made of small squares called **pixels**.
Each pixel has 3 color values: Red, Green, Blue (RGB).
* **Video** is just many images shown fast.
* **Sound** is numbers showing how loud or soft each moment is.

5. Algorithms

An **algorithm** is a clear list of steps to solve a problem.
Example: finding a name in a phone book.
* Check every name -> **O(n)** (slow)
* Cut the book in half each time -> **O(log n)** (faster)

6. Pseudocode

Before real code, you can write **pseudocode** - fake code in plain English.
It helps plan your program.

7. Scratch

Scratch is a visual coding tool with colorful blocks.
You can drag and snap blocks to make animations or games.
It teaches basic ideas:
* **Loops**: repeat actions
* **Conditionals**: do something if a condition is true
* **Variables**: store values (like a score)
* **Functions**: small reusable actions
* **Events**: something happens and code reacts (like a click)

8. Big Idea: Abstraction

Hide details to make big problems simpler.
Example: you drive a car without needing to know how the engine works.

9. Course Goal

Learn how to **think like a computer scientist** - to break problems into smaller, logical steps.
You'll start easy, then code for real later (in C, Python, etc.).
